%|chapter "Usage"


  %|section "Command-line interface"

    <pre><%= `ruby bin/#{$program} -h` %></pre>

    The first command-line argument to <%= $project %> is either the name of a predefined format (FormatName) or the path to a <%= xref "SpecFile", "format specification file" %> (FormatFile).

    Predefined formats are simply short-hand names of format specification files located in the <tt>fmt/</tt> subdirectory of the <%= $project %> installation directory (see <%= xref "Package contents" %>).


    %|section "Saving the output to a file"

      Simply redirect the standard ouput stream (STDOUT) to a file like this:

          <%= $program %> > YOUR_PATH_HERE

      In the above example, *YOUR\_PATH\_HERE* is the path of the file in which the output should be saved.


      %|important "Save XHTML output as <tt>.xhtml</tt>"

        When you use the XHTML format, ensure that the file extension of your saved output document is either <tt>.xhtml</tt> or <tt>.xml</tt>. Alternatively, ensure that your saved output document is served to web browsers under the <tt>application/xhtml+xml</tt> mime type.

        Otherwise, most web browsers _will not display_ the icons and graphics embedded in the saved XHTML output document because they will treat it as HTML instead of as XML.  See [this QuirksMode.org bug report](http://www.quirksmode.org/bugreports/archives/2005/02/custom_dtds_int_1.html) for details.


  %|section "Unindenting nodes hierarchically"

    When writing <%= $project %> documents, I prefer to indent the content of nodes according to their depth because my [text editor of choice](http://jedit.org) automatically folds blocks of text based on indentation.

    If you also prefer to write documents in this way, be sure to pass the <tt>--unindent</tt> option to <%= $project %> so that the indentation will not affect the resulting output.
