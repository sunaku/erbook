erbook is an extensible document generator based on eRuby that
emits plain text, HTML, LaTeX, UNIX man page, and your own
custom format.  It is a light (200 lines of code), extensible
(define your own custom formats), and flexible (your content
is scriptable) alternative to DocBook, Deplate, and SiSU.
