erbook : write books and documents in eRuby
===========================================

erbook is an extensible document processor that emits any document
format you can imagine (including those listed below) from eRuby
templates that allow scripting and dynamic content generation.

* XHTML (web page)
* LaTeX (PDF)               --- coming soon!
* UNIX manual page          --- coming soon!
* plain text                --- coming soon!

erbook is a light (210 source lines of code), extensible
(create your own document formats), and flexible (your content
is scriptable) alternative to DocBook, Deplate, and SiSU.
