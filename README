erbook : write books and documents in eRuby
===========================================

erbook is an extensible document processor that emits HTML
(web page), LaTeX (PDF), man (UNIX manual page), plain text,
and any document format you can imagine from eRuby templates
that allow scripting and dynamic content generation.

erbook is a light (200 source lines of code), extensible
(create your own document formats), and flexible (your content
is scriptable) alternative to DocBook, Deplate, and SiSU.
