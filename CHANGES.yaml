  This is the _first_ release of the Gerbil project. Happy birthday!

  Please note that although the "user guide":guide.html says you can install Gerbil via RubyGems, currently there is "a bug in RubyGems version 0.9.5":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=16202&group_id=126&atid=575 that prevents me from creating an installable gem without strictly adhering to RubyGems convention of putting executable programs inside a <tt>bin/</tt> directory.

  Until this issue is resolved, please download the tarball/zip packages instead.
